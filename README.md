DAFO is a metahuman fashion club (i.e. a fashion collective in the Metaverse) launched on March 24th made up of Fashion Designers, CEOs, CMOs, CTOs, VPs, Professors, Students, Models, Artists, Mentors and Activists worried about the growing dirty side, overconsumption and tired of anti-inclusive standards leading to objectification of women/men/non-binary people.

At DAFO, we join forces to create a better world with a sustainable fashion future thanks to the Metaverse and the Blockchain.
